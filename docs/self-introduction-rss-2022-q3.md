### Self introduction for Rolling Scopes School

---

### Transcription:

#### Who I am:

    Hello there!

    My name is Sasha. I am twenty-eight years old, a beginner software engineer.
    I'm from a small town a few hundred meters from Moscow, Russia.
    I have experience as a system administrator in several companies (four years),
    designer in an advertising company (two years) and
    support of machine learning in the IT department of a bank and a publishing house (one year).

#### Education:

    I am a graduate of a college of information technology and a little an art college.
    I am currently studying at Rolling Scopes School.

#### Motivation:

    I started this course mainly because I want to combine my work experience 
    and make my old and future projects more complex, interactive and interesting.
    I like what I do most of the time and I want people to enjoy it.

#### Hobby / Pet projects:

    Until recently, as a hobby, I administered a network of 20 computers on the Mikrotik 
    technique and also optimized and refactored my old Python scripts for sorting and clustering texts.
    At the moment I'm fixing and refactoring my old projects from stage 0 and early stage 1
    to get a better CV than I can show in future job searches.

#### What now:

    Now I would like to get a mentor to grow as a front end developer.
    That's all. Thanks for watching this video.
